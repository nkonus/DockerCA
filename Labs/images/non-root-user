Working with Non-privileged Users
In this lesson, you will learn how to use the USER instruction to create a non-privileged user. Rather than using root, we can use a non-privileged user to configure and run an application.

Setup your environment:

cd docker_images
mkdir non-privileged-user
cd non-privileged-user
Create the Dockerfile:

vi Dockerfile
Dockerfile contents:

# Creates a CentOS image that uses cloud_user as a non-privileged user
FROM centos:latest
RUN useradd -ms /bin/bash cloud_user
USER cloud_user
Build the new image:

docker image build -t centos7/nonroot:v1 .
Create a container using the new image:

docker container run -it --name test-build centos7/nonroot:v1 /bin/bash
Connecting as a privileged user:

docker container start test-build
docker container exec -u 0 -it test-build /bin/bash
